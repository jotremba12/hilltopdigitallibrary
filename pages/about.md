## About the Collection

This digital collection of archival materials showcases the history of the [Hilltop Garden and Nature Center](https://hilltop.indiana.edu/index.html) in Bloomington, Indiana. The creation of this digital library is inspired by the 75th Anniversary of the Hilltop Garden and Nature Center and aims to share some of the uniquely made marketing materials used by Hilltop as well as photographs of the gardening. The founder of Hilltop, Dr. Barbara Shalucha was a faculty member in the Indiana University botany department and built the garden as a youth-work centered community garden that collaborated with the city of Bloomington and Indiana University.

## About the Staff
